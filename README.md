  ## Description

The **Note Taker** is an application that enables users to write, save, and organize their notes efficiently. This application utilizes an Express.js backend to manage note data and store it in a JSON file. The application's frontend has already been developed; my task was to build the backend, establish the connection between the frontend and backend, and deploy the complete application to Heroku.

## Motivation

The primary motivation behind creating the Note Taker application is to provide a simple and user-friendly tool for small business owners or anyone who needs to organize their thoughts and tasks. By having an easy-to-use note-taking application, users can jot down important information, ideas, or to-do lists and access them conveniently.

## Challenge

My challenge was implementing the backend functionality of the Note Taker application. Which involved creating API routes for retrieving and saving notes. The backend stores notes with unique identifiers in a JSON file. Additionally, I had to have the option to implement the bonus feature, which allows users to delete notes.

## What I Learned

Throughout this project, I was able to  gain experience in:

- Setting up an Express.js backend for handling API requests.
- Storing and retrieving data using the fs module and JSON files.
- Connecting the frontend and backend of an application.
- Deploying an application to Heroku.
- Implementing optional features to enhance user experience.
